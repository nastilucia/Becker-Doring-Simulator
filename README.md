# Becker-Doring-Simulator
# Project Title: Becker-Döring simulation

# Prerequisite
Python 2.7 
Suggested notebook: Jupyter

# Description
This tool has been built to simulate a system based on Becker-Döring equations, which describe condensation phenomena at different pressures. They consist of two main processes: the aggregation and the fragmentation of clusters of particles. The applications of this kinetic model are multiple and include many fields, like physics, chemistry, and biology. In particular, concerning biology, it has been applied to study protein aggregation, polymerization, and the formation of intracellular concentration gradients.


# Running the tests


If you are running the code on Jupyter, copy the code on a new notebook (python 2.7), click on “restart -> restart & run all”. 
The code returns a plot, which has on the vertical axis the concentrations of clusters and on the horizontal axis the time. 

In a Linux shell window (or similarly for other platforms) call
the file.py in the python directory. (Follows this guide for help: https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/) 


#Notes

To have a complete background on this topic,  have a look on the Chapter 6 of the 
PhD thesis of Lucia Nasti: “Verification of Robustness property of chemical reaction networks”.
