# Becker-Doring-Simulator
This tool has been built to simulate a system based on Becker-Doring equations, describing condensation phenomena at different pressures. They consist of two main processes: the aggregation and the fragmentation of clusters of particles. The applications of this kinetic model are multiple and include many fields, like physics, chemistry, and biology. In particular, concerning biology, it has been applied to study protein aggregation, polymerization, and the formation of intracellular concentration gradients.
